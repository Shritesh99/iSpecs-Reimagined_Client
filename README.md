This is the Client side repository of iSpecs in which request is sent and recieved to server by client via rasberrypi.

##### New Features!
  - separate client and server repos 
  - better accuracy 

#### checkout the server repo [here](https://github.com/Shritesh99/iSpecs-Reimagined_Server)
#### Checkout the manual version [here](https://github.com/Shritesh99/iSpecs)

In iSpecs the client raspberry pi sends the images obtain by picamera as a POST request and get the response of object detection in json format which will be spoken via tts engine in client.
### Tech
server mainly uses YOLO system for object detection:
* [Yolo v3](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/) - real-time object detection system
* Django -  handling client request

### Development
In this repo the both files client.py and ispecs.php is kept inside the /var/www/html/ispecs folder in Raspberry Pi integrated with Apache 2.0 Server.


### Installation

For runnning the python script call :

```sh
http://{ip address of raspberry pi}/ispecs/ispecs.php?ip={ip address where iSpecs server is running with port}
```
